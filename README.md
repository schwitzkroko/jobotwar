# jobotwar
A RobotWar - inspired programming game

jobotwar builds upon the concept of the classic Robot War programming game. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobotWar for information
on the classic game.

The game takes place on a plane of 640x480 pixels, where up to twelve robots are fighting each other. Test your programming skills using either jobotwar's new state-based programming language, or a language that is very close to the one used by the classic Robot War game.

This screenshot shows jobotwar's V2 language:

And here is some game play footage:

The game includes implementations of classic Robot Wars and crobots programs like Mover, Shooter and Corner, plus it adds many fresh designs as samples.
